# readRelax

## DeltaHacks IV, McMaster University

*DeltaHacks* uses **a Leap motion controller** to track your hand movements and flip pages of a virtual book as if you were doing it in real life. It also allows you to gradually increase your reading speed using principles of **speed reading**.

## About
readRelax uses a Leap Motion to create an immersive speed reading experience. 

The problem with speed reading is that it presents a large learning curve. Using readRelax, we can help students increase their reading speed by only **gradually** increasing their reading speed, and doing so in a way that is comfortable for them. 

### Technology
* Python
* Xesto Wave API to track motion of the hand

### Next Steps
In the future, we'd like to:
* create a more immersive frontend using Virtual Reality i.e. an Oculus Rift
