# readRelax
readRelax is a motion controlled reading experience developed at DeltaHacks IV by myself and my teammates. We utilized speed reading principles as well as a Leap Motion to introduce motion controlled immersive reading via the Xesto api. I developed the backend using Node.js , the front end files were written by my teammates.  This project was a finalist (Top 6) at DeltaHacks IV, and won Xesto's challenge for "Best use of the Xesto API".
